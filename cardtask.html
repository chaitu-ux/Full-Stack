       <p id="matter"> Animators create the foundation of a scene by drawing characters, designing backgrounds, and animating the scene. Animation is also known as motion graphics.

VFX artists enhance the animation by adding special effects like fire, water, wind, and particles. VFX artists also manipulate imagery after a scene has been shot. 
Animation is used in animated television shows, ads, promotions, CDs, and websites. VFX is used in movies, TV shows, documentaries, and theatrical releases.
